334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) 
such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.

sol1:
Using the same approach as prefix and suffix. First traverse the nums array and 
calculate the leftmin of i elements.

Then, calculate the rightmax of i elements.
Next, compare: leftmin[i]<nums[i]<rightmax[i]

sol2:
Using the least and the second least approach. Calculating the least as firstmin
and the second least as the secondmin, if any element greater than secondmin is present
we find the triplet adn hence, return true.
