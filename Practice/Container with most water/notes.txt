11. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical 
lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

explanation: move the pointer with lower level of water and update max volume
despite using while loop, it's linear time.
