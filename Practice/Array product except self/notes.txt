238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is 
equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Calculating prefix and suffix and then multiplying them to get the answer vector
