283. Move Zeroes
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining 
the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array

Approach 1:
Erased all the zeroes and appended zeroes in the end of the nums vector.

Approach 2:
Moved all the non-zero elements to the front, and appended the zeroes in the end of the nums vector.
