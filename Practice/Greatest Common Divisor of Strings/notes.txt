1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t 
(i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

explanation: the length of the GCD string will be of size gcd(str1,str2)
extract the string and then check for subsequent substrings of str1 and str2, 
if it matches then return the gcdString. Otherwise, return null string.
