3264. Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I
You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier.
You need to perform k operations on nums. In each operation:

Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, 
select the one that appears first. Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier.
Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations.

Explanation:
Using an unordered hash map, I have stored {index, value} pairs, and pushed the values in a min 
priority queue. For k loops, top of priority queue is popped->index of the value stored->
value manipulated->change is done in the unordered hash map.
