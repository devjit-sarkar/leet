You are given an integer n. We reorder the digits in any order 
(including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return true if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number 
is a power of two.

Initial thought:
Since the numbers given can be reordered, anagram approach can be used.
Now, to lower execution time, we can find the lowest power of 2 such that
it has the same number of digits as the greatest number that can be formed 
using digits of n.
